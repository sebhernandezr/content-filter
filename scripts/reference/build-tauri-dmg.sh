# Build a signed + notarized Spark.app / DMG from the Tauri UI (gui-tauri), embedding the
# com.digiexam.macos.NetworkExtensions.ContentFilter system extension — the content-filter (lockdown)
# product, the only system extension Spark ships. This is the macOS product DMG (the former Flutter
# build-gui-dmg.sh was removed; Tauri is the single cross-platform UI).
#
# Env knobs:
#   SIGN_IDENTITY   Developer ID Application identity (auto-detected from the keychain otherwise)
#   APP_PROFILE     path to the "Spark macOS App" .provisionprofile (auto-located from the Xcode store)
#   NOTARY_PROFILE  notarytool keychain profile, OR
#   AC_USERNAME + AC_PASSWORD  Apple-ID + app-specific password
#   SKIP_NOTARIZE=1 build signed-but-not-notarized (fast local iteration)
#   NOTARY_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for each notarization verdict (default 1800). On timeout the
#                   submission id is printed so the wait can be resumed without rebuilding.
#   NOTARY_SUBMIT_TRIES  upload attempts before giving up (default 3); Apple's notary endpoint
#                   intermittently connect-times-out, and a failed upload has no id to resume from.
#   REUSE_SYSEXT    path to a prebuilt .systemextension to embed instead of building one (keeps the
#                   sysext version stable → reinstall needs no reboot; for app-only Rust/JS changes)
#   MAC_ARCH        macOS arch: arm64 (default) or x86_64. x86_64 → a separate Spark-x86_64.dmg.
#   OUTPUT_DIR      where Spark.app + the DMG land (default: dist/); the DMG is Spark.dmg for
#                   arm64 and Spark-x86_64.dmg for MAC_ARCH=x86_64
